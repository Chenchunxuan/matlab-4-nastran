This example shows the application of the object-oriented framework to the modelling of an aeroelastically tailored composite wing. To produce the results of this example run the script `CompositeWingMain.m`. This in turns calls the routine `Proteus2Nastran.m`, which was developed to translate a wing model in [Proteus](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0263822316318669) (an aeroelastic tailoring framework developed at TU Delft) into a wing model in Nastran. The workflow of `Proteus2Nastran.m` is shown in the figure below.
